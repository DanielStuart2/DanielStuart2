# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer from **Brazil** (GMT-3, SÃ£o Paulo timezone) and a proud FIAP graduate with a strong passion for **Python** and **Data Science**. I love diving into data, building intelligent solutions, and exploring the endless possibilities of machine learning and AI.

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** finances, where I code using **C#** and manage data with fintech tools like **PortfolioOne** and **OMS**.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** more about **C#** to enhance my skills in software development and improving my **Spanish** skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** anything **Python** or **data-related**, as I also have experience with **SQL**, managing data, and creating views and dashboards.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss anything tech-related. Let's connect and create something amazing! ðŸš€
